The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.
This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly 
interesting new concept in C programming: "static variables"
GNL Mandatory Part
Your program must compile with the flag -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx. which will be used as the buffer size for the read calls in your get_next_line.
Make sure that your function behaves well when it reads from a file and when it reads from the standard input.
